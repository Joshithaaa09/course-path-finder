Personalized Filtering: Users can filter a predefined list of courses by selecting their primary Branch (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering) and a Personal Interest (e.g., Technology, Business, Health).

Tailored Results: The application cross-references the selected branch and interest to provide highly specific course recommendations.

Session Management: Keeps track of the logged-in user session.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Backend: Python 3
